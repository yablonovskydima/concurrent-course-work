## Description

This coursework focuses on implementing synchronization in Java using the resources provided by the `java.util.concurrent` package. The main emphasis is on thread-safe collections and concurrency utilities such as `ExecutorService`, `ReentrantLock`, `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`, and others.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate safe data handling in a multi-threaded environment, highlight the advantages of specialized thread-safe collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`), and ensure efficient and correct thread interaction without relying on primitive synchronization (`synchronized`).

The project includes examples of common concurrency tasks, showcases potential issues caused by improper synchronization, and presents solutions using modern concurrency tools from the `java.util.concurrent` package.
